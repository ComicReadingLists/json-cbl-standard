# Comic Reading List JSON Standard

Welcome to the Comic Reading List JSON Standard project! This initiative aims to create a standardized format for comic reading lists using JSON, making it easier for developers, publishers, and readers to share and manage comic reading data.

## Overview
The Comic Reading List JSON Standard seeks to define a common structure for representing comic reading lists. This will facilitate interoperability between different comic reading applications and platforms, allowing for seamless sharing and management of reading lists.

## Getting Started
To get started with the Comic Reading List JSON Standard, you'll need to:

Review the Draft 1.0 Specification: Familiarize yourself with the current version of the standard.
Implement the Standard: Use the specification to create or modify comic reading list applications.
Test and Provide Feedback: Help us refine the standard by testing it in real-world scenarios and providing feedback.

## Draft Specification
The Draft version of the Comic Reading List JSON Standard is available here.

Reading List Metadata: Information about the reading list such as title, description, and creation date.
Comic Entries: Each comic entry includes details like title, issue number, publisher, release date, and optional metadata such as author and artist.
Ordering and Grouping: Options for ordering and grouping comics within the reading list.
Database: Points to a database that contains information about the series and issue.
