# Comic Reading List JSON Standard

Welcome to the Comic Reading List JSON Standard project! This initiative aims to create a standardized format for comic reading lists using JSON, making it easier for developers, publishers, and readers to share and manage comic reading data.

## Overview
The Comic Reading List JSON Standard seeks to define a common structure for representing comic reading lists. This will facilitate interoperability between different comic reading applications and platforms, allowing for seamless sharing and management of reading lists.

## Getting Started
To get started with the Comic Reading List JSON Standard, you'll need to:

Review the 1.0 Specification: Familiarize yourself with the current version of the standard.  
Implement the Standard: Use the specification in your program. If you do end up impelmenting the spec, please reach out to us on discord so we open a line of communication and can keep people updated when changes happen. 
Provide Feedback: Help us refine the standard by testing it in real-world scenarios and providing feedback.

## Draft Specification
There currently isn't a draft in the pipeline. The existing draft got promoted to v1.0 on 9/3/2024. When the time comes to make modifications to the existing spec we'll open another draft preview. 

## Feedback and Testing
Even with the release of 1.0, your input is crucial to ensure the standard meets the needs of the community. While we tried to cover as many situations as possible, there still might be something we missed during the design phase. 

Open an Issue: If you encounter any issues or have suggestions, open an issue in the repository.
